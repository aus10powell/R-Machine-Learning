# kaggle
#### Thanks for visiting!


For the most part, I participate in Kaggle with the goal of learning rather than moving up the leaderboard. A specific example of that is one compition where I was not very familiar with sparse matrix implementation in Python even though code was already available.

*Disclamer: I can't claim that all the code shown is 100 percent original, but I feel that is the beauty of coding is that you in a sense crowd-source ideas and make them work for you. Since most of the time I participate in Kaggle in order to learn, I try to replicate code that I don't understand.*
